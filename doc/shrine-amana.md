# Shrine of Amana

This area is chock-a-block with enemies that can easily overwhelm you. Fight one
enemy at a time and use a ranged weapon such as bow and arrows. Take your time
exploring the area and pay particular attention to enemies lying in the water
waiting to ambush you. Have a Short Bow or Long Bow ready; the Dragonrider Bow
is recommended. Ensure you have a few hundred arrows. Wooden Arrows are OK, but
Iron Arrows are recommended. You will use a bow and arrows to lure enemies one
at a time away from its mob and to your location, where you can easily dispatch
of a single enemy.

Notable loots:

-   Estus Flask Shard. On a narrow ledge guarded by Amana Shrine Maiden x 2. An
    Ogre blocks your path to these two Shrine Maidens.
-   Sunlight Blade. Found inside a chest near where you grabbed the Estus Flask
    Shard. This miracle requires 36 Faith so you probably won't be able to use
    it until NG+1. In the meantime, Gold Pine Resin is more than enough to deal
    with bosses in NG+0, your first playthrough.
-   Life Ring+2. Guarded by an Ogre who stands behind a bunch of tree branches.
-   King's Crown. Located within a room that is accessible by crossing a stone
    bridge. The bridge is guarded by a Dragonrider. At the moment, you should
    ignore this item because the room won't open until you have defeated
    Vendrick.
-   Red Iron Twinblade. A powerful weapon that scales only with Strength. When
    two-handed, its fast consecutive attacks can make short work of many enemies
    and bosses. Found on a corpse after Rhoy's Resting Place bonfire.
-   Key to the Embedded. Dropped by the area boss, i.e. the Demon of Song. After
    defeating the boss, complete the Milfanito's quest line. Use the Key to the
    Embedded to rescue a Milfanito imprisoned high above Drangleic Castle.
    Talking to her would reward you with the Ring of the Dead. In case you
    haven't done so, exhaust the dialogue of the first Milfanito you encountered
    at the Shrine of Amana and the Milfanito sitting before the boss arena. Now
    locate a Milfanito who attends the Altar of Amana. She is locked behind the
    Door of the Undead, above the Rise of the Dead bonfire. The Door can only be
    opened when you are in hollow form. Open the Door and exhaust her dialogue
    to receive these items: Smooth and Silky Stone, Fire Seed, and Divine
    Blessing. Now return to the first Milfanito at the Shrine of Amana. Exhaust
    her dialogue to receive your reward.

Near the boss arena, you would be invaded by Peculiar Kindalur. He uses magic
and hex. Be sure to boost your magic and dark defense. Use a shield that has as
high magic and dark defense as possible. Summon Felicia the Brave to help you
against the NPC invader.

## Demon of Song

This boss is protected by an impenetrable coat that looks like a giant toad. The
boss can only be damaged once it exposes its head and arms. Buff your weapon
with magic or dark. Stack as much physical defense as possible.
