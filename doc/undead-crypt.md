# Undead Crypt

Stock up on Repair Powder and Lifegem x 99 prior to exploring this area. You
want to grab everything in one go and not resting at a bonfire or using a
Homeward Bone. Find Grave Warden Agdayne near a group of Grave Wardens. Don't
bring light near him such as lighting your torch or letting the torch hollow
follow you. Exhaust Agdayne's dialogue, purchase all Elizabeth Mushrooms and
anything else you need from him, and his summon sign would be available for the
upcoming boss. Devotee Scarlett's summon sign can be found in a room containing
Leydia Witch x 2, before you meet Agdayne.

The Leydia Pyromancers are the deadliest enemies in this area. Each is spawned
from a large tombstone. As long as a tombstone is intact, ringing a nearby bell
would cause a Leydia Pyromancer to spawn. Break each tombstone as quickly as
possible. The tombstones are usually surrounded by a number of stones. Breaking
the tombstones and the various stones can rapidly decrease the durability of
your weapon.

You should try to first clear the area of enemies without NPC summons and break
all the gravestones of Leydia Pyromancers. Then light two sconces to spawn
several NPC red phantoms known as Insolents. Each defeated Insolent has a chance
to drop Twinkling Titanite or a Fragrant Branch of Yore, among other items. You
want a Fragrant Branch as the item can help you progress in the game. Each
Insolent can deal lightning and dark damage, and can be difficult to fight solo.
Summon at least one NPC to help you distract an Insolent.

Notable loots:

-   Crushed Eye Orb. Inside a chest located above a steep ladder, found after
    exiting the room where Agdayne is located. This item is used to invade Licia
    at Majula. The main purpose of invading and defeating Licia is to obtain the
    Soothing Sunlight miracle, required for obtaining the Master of Miracles
    Steam achievement.
-   Bracing Knuckle Ring+2. Found in a room adjacent to where the Undead Ditch
    bonfire is located. Equip the ring to slow the degradation of your equipped
    weapons, rings, and armour pieces.
-   Avelyn. Found in an iron chest behind an illusory wall, near the hallway
    where the Nameless Usurper NPC invades you. The Avelyn is the best crossbow
    in the game because it can shoot three bolts at a time, useful for chipping
    the HP of most enemies.
-   Fragrant Branch of Yore. Inside one of four iron chests in front of the boss
    arena. Has a chance to be dropped by an NPC red phantom Insolent.

## Velstadt, the Royal Aegis

This boss is weak against lightning. The following attacks can be parried: the
two- and one-handed horizontal swing, and the downward two-handed vertical
swing. A parry cannot be followed by a riposte. However, a successful parry
would give you a small window to deal some damage. Getting a successful parry on
Velstadt can be difficult, so you might as well fight him instead of baiting a
parry. You can summon any of the following NPCs to help you distract Velstadt:
Agdayne and Devotee Scarlett.

Defeat Velstadt, enter a room where hollowed Vendrick walks around in circle,
and grab the King's Ring. The ring is required to open passages to various
end-game bosses. Don't attack Vendrick at the moment.
