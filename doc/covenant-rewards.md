# Obtain covenant rewards

Farming for covenant items can be tedious. However, some covenants reward you
with various spells that are required to unlock certain Steam achievements.
Start farming for covenant items before proceeding to the next NG cycle. Farm
the target enemies until they no longer respawn, at which point you might want
to burn a Bonfire Ascetic to revive them or wait until the next NG cycle to farm
the same enemies again. Equip these to boost your item discovery: Jester's Cap,
Prisoner's Tatters, Watchdragon Parma, Covetous Gold Serpent Ring(+0, +1, +2).
Pop a Rusted Coin before you start a farming round. It is mandatory to rank up
in the following covenants to unlock certain Steam achievements: Bell Keepers,
Heirs of the Sun, Pilgrims of Dark. Below are some covenant items you might want
to farm.

1. Obtain all covenant rewards from the Bell Keepers covenant. Join the covenant
   and play offline to prevent PvP. Clear Iron Keep of all enemies and use the
   Unveil miracle by the Belfry Sol Approach bonfire to help you determine
   whether the Mad Warrior spawns. After defeating the Mad Warrior 30 times,
   exhaust the dialogue of the Belfry Guard and be rewarded with the Hidden
   Weapon sorcery. Levelling up in the Bell Keepers covenant is the only way to
   obtain this sorcery. You must collect all sorceries to unlock a Steam
   achievement. This video has more details:

1. Rank up in the Rat King covenant either through PvP or farm Rat Tail x 35 by
   killing rats at the Grave of Saints. Give the Rat Tail x 35 to the Rat King
   to receive all covenant rewards. None of the covenant rewards are required to
   unlock a Steam achievement.
1. Ranking up in the Heirs of the Sun covenant is the only way to obtain all
   covenant rewards. You need the Sunlight Spear miracle to unlock a Steam
   achievement. Farm Sunlight Medal x 30 either through jolly co-operation by
   helping hosts defeat bosses or by farming the Falconers. Falconers are found
   at these locations:

-   Near the Ruined Fork Road bonfire, on the path to Drangleic Castle.
-   Near the Royal Army Campsite bonfire, at Brightstone Cove Tseldora.
-   From NG+1 onward, Falconers are found near your initial spawn point at
    Things Betwixt.

1. Rank up in the Company of Champions covenant to obtain all rewards. Upon
   reaching rank 1, you would be rewarded with Great Magic Weapon, a sorcery
   that can be purchased from Royal Sorcerer Navlaan or collected at the Black
   Gulch. You don't need to rank up in this covenant to unlock a Steam
   achievement. Refer to the section [Grave of Saints](./grave-saints.md) for
   how to farm Awestones.
1. All rewards from the Blue Sentinels, Way of Blue, and Brotherhood of Blood
   covenants can be obtained through other means. You don't need to join these
   covenants and PvP in order to obtain all rewards. Purchase all items from
   Blue Sentinel Targray and then defeat him to obtain his Blue Knight's
   Halberd. Purchase all items from Titchy Gren and then defeat him to obtain
   the Nahr Alma Hood. The Nahr Alma Robes and the Scythe of Nahr Alma can both
   be purchased from Melentia. Refer to the section
   [Grave of Saints](./grave-saints.md) for how to increase your rank in the Way
   of Blue covenant.
1. Rank up in the Dragon Remnants covenant to obtain all rewards. You require
   Dragon Scale x 30, which can be farmed through PvP or from defeating the
   Dragon Warriors at Dragon Shrine. The Dragon Warriors can be tough to fight
   because they tend to gank you. Dragon Scales can also be farmed from The
   Imperfect at Shulva, Sanctum City. None of the covenant rewards are required
   to unlock a Steam achievement. Refer to the sections
   [Dragon Shrine](./dragon-shrine.md) and [Shulva, Sanctum City](./shulva.md)
   for how to farm Dragon Scales.
1. Exhaust the dialogue of Darkdiver Grandahl at these locations: Shaded Woods,
   Black Gulch, and Drangleic Castle. Then join the Pilgrims of Dark covenant.
   Clear all three Dark Chasms of Old and defeat Darklurker to receive all
   covenant rewards. The hex Climax can only be obtained after reaching rank 3
   in the covenant. You require all hexes to unlock a Steam achievement. Refer
   to the section [Darklurker](./darklurker.md) for how to increase your rank in
   the Pilgrims of Dark covenant.
