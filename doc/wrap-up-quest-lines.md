You now only have to defeat the final boss of the game. Before doing so, take
some time to complete all side quests and obtain your rewards. This check list
might help:

1. Cale the Cartographer should now be at Majula. Exhaust his dialogue to
   receive his armour set. You need his helm as part of Navlaan's quest line.
1. Talk to Laddersmith Gilligan at Majula. Purchase all three ladders from him
   to help you descend the Pit. If you haven't already done so, purchase the
   Ladder Miniature from Gilligan. Then exhaust his dialogue to receive the Melu
   Scimitar. You need the Ladder Miniature as part of Navlaan's quest line.
1. By now the Flexile Sentry should be defeated. Have at least 8 Intelligence
   and exhaust the dialogue of Carhillion of the Fold. Carhillion should then
   relocate to Majula. While he is at Majula, have at least 30 Intelligence and
   exhaust his dialogue to receive the Northern Ritual Band+1.
1. In the current playthrough, if your character has died at least 100 times,
   exhaust the dialogue of Saulden the Crestfallen Warrior to receive the Ring
   of Steel Protection. Deaths from being summoned as a phantom don't count.
   When at least four NPCs have relocated to Majula, talk to Saulden to receive
   a Soul Vessel.
1. Stone Trader Chloanne should be at Majula by now. Spend at least 20,000 souls
   by purchasing items from Chloanne and she would gift you a Twinkling
   Titanite.
1. Spend at least 15,000 souls at the shop of Maughlin the Armourer. Now have
   exactly 0 souls in your soul counter, either by suicide your character or use
   the Darksign. Then exhaust Maughlin's dialogue to receive the Transparent
   Aurous armour set. He would drop the Tseldora armour set upon death, but you
   should instead farm the set from the Parasitized Undead found at Brightstone
   Cove Tseldora.
1. Licia of Lindeldt should now be at the Majula Rotunda. Enter the Rotunda
   while having the Crushed Eye Orb in your inventory. Use the Orb to invade
   Licia and defeat her to obtain these items: Rotunda Lockstone, the Saint's
   Set, Idol's Chime, and Soothing Sunlight. You require Soothing Sunlight to
   obtain the Master of Miracles Steam achievement.
1. Have at least 20 Intelligence and 20 Faith. Exhaust the dialogue of Felkin
   the Outcast and he would gift you the Sunset Staff and the Hexer's armour
   set. The Sunset Staff is required to advance Navlaan's quest line.
1. Assuming you have not released Royal Sorcerer Navlaan, you now have all four
   items to complete his quest line. Be in hollow form and exhaust his dialogue
   to receive four rewards from him as well as his armour set.
1. Once the Giant Lord is defeated, exhaust the dialogue of Chancellor Wellager
   to receive the Royal Dirk, Espada Ropera, and the Llewellyn armour set.
1. Have at least 35 Faith and exhaust the dialogue of Cromwell the Pardoner to
   receive the Ring of Resistance.
1. Trade as many boss souls as possible with Straid of Olaphis to obtain
   sorceries, pyromancies, miracles, and hexes from him. You must collect all
   sorceries, pyromancies, miracles, and hexes in order to obtain the
   corresponding Steam achievements. After trading at least four boss souls with
   Straid, he would gift you his armour set.
1. Obtain the King's Ring located in Vendrick's chamber. Exhaust the dialogue of
   Grave Warden Agdayne to receive his armour set and the Darkdrift katana.
1. Collect the remaining Fragrant Branches of Yore and unpetrify any statues.
   Defeat the unpetrified enemies to collect some treasures. In particular,
   unpetrify all enemies at Shaded Woods and Aldia's Keep.

1. Defeat Vendrick at the Undead Crypt, in the area after Velstadt's boss arena.
   Have Soul of a Giant x 5 in your inventory to lower Vendrick's defense. Buff
   your weapon with Aromatic Ooze, Charcoal Pine Resin, or Gold Pine Resin. Once
   Vendrick is defeated, grab the King's Crown at the Shrine of Amana, locked
   behind a door. You must be in human form and Vendrick must be defeated for
   the door to open. The following items should now be in your inventory: King's
   Crown, Crown of the Sunken King, Crown of the Old Iron King, and Crown of the
   Ivory King. Enter the Memory of the King by interacting with the corpse in
   the room where you fought Vendrick. Exhaust Vendrick's dialogue to receive
   his blessing and unlock a hidden cutscene.

    {% youtube id="HURN76AUD_s", title="86. Treasures at Iron Keep, Dark Souls II: SotFS" %}{% endyoutube %}

1. Collect all treasures scattered on molten rocks at Iron Keep. Equip armour
   pieces that offer the highest fire defense, Flame Quartz Ring+3, Dispelling
   Ring+1, and Ring of Restoration. Cast Flash Sweat. Note that casting
   Replenishment or Resplendent Life would cancel Flash Sweat. The following
   armour pieces offer decent fire defense: Smelter Demon Helm, Black Witch
   Robe, Smelter Demon Gaunlets, Hexer's Boots. Pop Lifegem x 3 and you should
   be able to traverse the molten rocks. Chug an Estus Flask as necessary.
   Ensure you have zero souls in your soul counter in case your character dies.
1. Other miscellaneous treasures you have not collected. For example, Havel's
   armour set is found behind two stone doors at The Gutter. Start from the
   Upper Gutter bonfire.
