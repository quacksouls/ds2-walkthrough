# Harvest Valley & Earthen Peak

Harvest Valley and Earthen Peak are poison areas. Having Poison Moss might be a
good idea, but you should also stock up on Lifegem x 99. As soon as you are
poisoned, pop Lifegem x 3 to regenerate your HP. Regularly pop two or three
Lifegems until the poison metre has depleted. The Altar of Sunlight is hidden
inside a cave. Kneel in front of the altar, but it isn't necessary to join the
covenant at the moment.

Advance the quest lines of these NPCs:

-   In case Chloanne hasn't relocated to Majula yet, exhaust her dialogue, rest
    at a bonfire, and she should relocate to Majula. You need Chloanne to move
    to Majula because she would sell Titanite Chunks, among other upgrade
    materials, after you have defeated certain main bosses.
-   You will meet Gavlan for the second time. Exhaust his dialogue and purchase
    some Poison Mosses. Ensure you have purchased all Poison Arrows and Poison
    Knives from him.
-   Lucatiel is found in a room after you have forded a poison pool. Exhaust her
    dialogue to receive the Ring of Steel Protection+1, an item that boosts your
    physical defense.
-   Pate is in a room with a door that can only be opened from one side. He will
    tell you to search for a treasure. Find the treasure nearby, open the door,
    and then exhaust his dialogue.
-   Laddersmith Gilligan is found near the top of Earthen Peak. He is the only
    merchant who sells Aromatic Ooze. Exhaust his dialogue and pay him 2,000
    souls for his ladder. Descend the ladder to grab the treasure below, then
    exhaust Gilligan's dialogue again and purchase the Ladder Miniature, an item
    that will be used for another NPC's quest line. After this, Gilligan should
    relocate to Majula. You need Gilligan to move to Majula because there he
    would sell a long ladder to help you safely descend the Pit.

Notable loots at Harvest Valley:

-   Titanite Chunk x 2. In the first large poison area. Kill all or most enemies
    first before you run to get the items. A few skeletons would spawn while you
    explore the poison area, which also has Titanite Shard x 6.
-   Fragrant Branch of Yore. On a corpse near Gavlan, who is in a cave near
    where you pick up the first Titanite Chunk.
-   Titanite Slab. In an area filled with poison gas, after The Mines bonfire.

## Covetous Demon

The boss is weak against weapons that have a thrusting attack, e.g. a rapier.
Buff your weapon with magic or fire. Dark Pine Resin is OK in case that is the
only weapon buff you have. The fight is trivial if you use a Long Bow (or a
Dragonrider Bow+1) and Iron Arrows to shoot the three hanging pots. The demon
would be busy devouring the enemies inside the pots, while you attack.

At Earthen Peak, you will face Mytha within a room filled with poison gas. The
gas will poison you and regenerate Mytha's HP. To get rid of the poison gas,
light the Central Earthen Peak bonfire, but don't rest at the bonfire. Opposite
the bonfire is a windmill. Use a torch to burn the windmill so it would stop
pumping poison into the arena of Mytha.

## Mytha, the Baneful Queen

You should have burnt the windmill found opposite to the Central Earthen Peak
bonfire, otherwise the boss arena would be filled with poison gas. Use a
thrusting weapon and buff your weapon with fire. Dark Pine Resin is also
effective, but Aromatic Ooze and Gold Pine Resin should be a last resort.

Defeat Mytha, ride the elevator up, and light the Threshold Bridge bonfire at
Iron Keep.
