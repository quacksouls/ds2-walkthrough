# Introduction

This guide is meant to help you in your first playthrough of Dark Souls II:
Scholar of the First Sin. The following is a list of tips to help you progress
and finish the game.

1. Unlike other games in the souls series, your invincibility frame (or i-frame)
   depends on a stat called Adaptability. Levelling up Adaptability would
   permanently increase your i-frames. A minimum of 16 Adaptability should allow
   you to roll through most attacks. Equipping some items would temporarily
   grant you more i-frames, but at the cost of taking more damage or hitting not
   as hard or taking up a ring slot. The more i-frames you have, the better
   because you would be able to roll through an attack that would otherwise be
   impossible with low i-frames. In general, you should avoid an enemy's attack
   by being outside of an attack's hit box, rather than rolling through an
   attack. This means you often must bait an attack and run in for the punish.
1. Vigor, Endurance, and Vitality are also important. Higher Vigor means more
   HP. Higher Endurance means you have more stamina for dashing or attacking
   with your weapon. Vitality is tied to your maximum equipment load. Higher
   Vitality means your character can equip heavier weapons and/or armour pieces.
   Always aim to be at less than 70% equipment load. Beyond 70% equipment load,
   your character would dash and roll slower.
1. Have a main weapon for dealing with regular enemies scattered throughout an
   area. Your main weapon can be an ultra great sword or a great hammer, any of
   which allows you to quickly dispatch of most enemies. Your main weapon might
   be slow, but it should hit hard. Have a secondary weapon for fighting bosses.
   Choose a secondary weapon that has a fast attack and recovery animation, e.g.
   a rapier. Your secondary weapon might not hit as hard as your main weapon,
   but its fast attack and recovery animation should allow you plenty of time to
   move away or dodge an incoming attack from a boss. Furthermore, consider
   investing in a ranged weapon such as a bow, crossbow, or great bow. The
   purpose of a ranged weapon is not to kill enemies, but to lure an enemy away
   from its mob and approach your location where you can engage in one-to-one
   combat.
1. Use Raw Stones to infuse your weapons. A raw weapon has high base damage
   output, but the weapon itself doesn't scale with your stats. You need only to
   invest enough points into Strength and/or Dexterity in order to properly
   wield the weapon. The damage output of a raw weapon can be further increased
   by upgrading the weapon with various upgrade materials. Buff your raw weapon
   with various elemental damage such as fire, magic, lightning, or dark for
   even more damage output.
1. After being invaded by a red phantom (NPC or otherwise), return to the
   Soldier's Rest bonfire, search for the nearby dead giant that looks like a
   tree trunk, and see whether a Seed of a Tree of Giants has appeared. Grab the
   Seed if you see it hanging from one of the giant's arms. Use the Seed to make
   enemies hostile toward invaders. All red phantom invaders can be handled
   without using a Seed. However, there is one particular NPC red phantom
   invader who often runs towards enemy mobs, tricking you into chasing after
   him. Don't chase after the invader. Instead, use a Seed and let enemy mobs
   deal with him.
1. Choose Knight as your starting class because that class has the second
   highest Adaptability, being at 9 Adaptability. The class with the highest
   starting Adaptability is the Explorer. However, the Knight gives you a decent
   armour set and weapon to deal with most enemies in the early game areas.
   Choose Healing Wares as your starting gift.
1. Use a shield to block, but don't rely on your shield to carry you through the
   game. Instead of blocking with a shield, it is often more effective to bait
   an attack, then move in for a hit or two. The Tower Shield is recommended,
   but it requires 30 Strength to wield properly.
1. Farming souls can help you to level up a few times before fighting a boss or
   exploring a difficult area, or to stock up on various consumables. You can
   minimize your time farming souls as follows. First, obtain the Covetous
   Silver Serpent Ring+1 as soon as possible and equip the ring. Second, when
   exploring an area defeat all enemies. Third, collect all items in an area.
   Some of the treasures are soul items that can be used to add to your souls
   counter.
1. Be patient and learn from your mistakes. Whenever possible, fight enemies one
   at a time or use a weapon that has a horizontal swing to deal with mobs. Take
   your time to explore an area. Any difficult enemy can be dealt with in one
   way or another. Learn an enemy's attack patterns, look for an opportunity to
   get in one or two hits, and study the environment to see how you can use the
   surroundings to your advantage.
